            <h1>WHO WE ARE</h1>
            <p>Every year, we change the lives of millions of students. We enable them to explore all their study options in one place and to find the best fit study programme that matches their needs, goals, and preferences. In order to succeed in this mission, we work with over 3,750+ universities, business schools, law schools, and pathway providers who are eager to diversify their campuses and attract the right students from all over the world.We consider international study experience extremely valuable to students’ development. Through our portals, we try to fill the information gap that hinders students from finding and starting their international studies. On this mission, there’s still a lot of work to be done, but we are working enthusiastically and welcome cooperation with students and universities.</p>

      <h1>WHAT WE DO</h1>
            <p>StudyPoint began as a spin-off from a couple of large international study associations. It was born out of frustration, a total lack of information and overview of the fast-growing number of international Master’s programmes in Europe. In 2007, Mastersportal.com was developed and proved to be a roaring success. Soon after, Bachelorsportal.com, PhDportal.com, Shortcoursesportal.com, and Distancelearningportal.com followed.
            In 2020, we helped 45 million students around the world to explore study programmes and make an informed choice, throughout over 200,000 courses at 3,750+ educational institutes across 110 countries.</p>
